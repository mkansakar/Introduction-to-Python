    "Hi! And welcome to the Python for Analysts training course. This covers everything you need to know to start using Python for data analysis and visualisation as well as showcasing some more advanced and snazzy stuff, including Statistics, Machine Learning, Web Scraping / Interaction etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The course assumes no prior knowledge of Python and will teach you everything you need to know in order to use Python for data analysis and visualisation, including interfacing with Python via the Jupyter interface, using Text Editors / Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), upgrading Python, working with the command line etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, note that the course can only hope to give you an introduction to Python for Data Analysis over the 3 days. You'll no doubt want to continue your learning afterward, and the course provides links to relevant material with which to further your development."
